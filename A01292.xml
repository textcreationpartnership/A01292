            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Lacedemonian common weale was eſtabliſhed by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> that famous lawmaker, by whoſe profitable directions and ordinances that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale did for the ſpace of ſixe hundred yeeres exceedingly floriſhe in equitie and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: but when the neglect of theſe Lawes had entred and pearced into the body of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, and wantonnes, licentiouſnes and deſire of monie had encroched into the place of theſe commodious orders, they loſt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme with their libertie, and the deformitie of mens manners did wholy diſfigure the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and decent proportion of that goodly Common weale. Now I come by your fauour to the Romane eſtate, that is, to the miracle of miracles (if any humane thing may beare ſo gorgious a title) ſurpaſsing farre her predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours in greatnes, happines, and continuance of time: the cauſe of which rare felicitie is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in truth, then the preſcript of good Lawes, made by <hi>Numa,</hi> and others, howſoeuer ſome partially affected, doe as their ſeuerall fanſies led the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aſcribe &amp; attribute the ſame to ſeueral cauſes, whoſe cenſures &amp; opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s giue me leaue by your

Secondly, becauſe other nations, with whom we haue commerce, &amp; entercourſe, doe not find their commodities or liberties to be impeached by this lawe. Thirdly, becauſe they are rather popular, then peremptorie, rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, then exacted, and rather embraced, then perſwaded.

Firſt it hath beene receiued of vs as a currant
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2840:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> rule from all antiquitie, that the deſendant may<note place="margin">4 Diſableme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in the perſon of the plaintife at the comon Law.</note> plead outlawrie in diſablement of the plaintife, but if he doe imparle nowe he cannot plead out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawrie to the diſablement of his perſon, but yet he may well plead it in barre of the action, <note n="n" place="margin">32.

E. 4. 35.</note> and ſo outlawrie is a good plea in barre of an action of debt: for by the outlawrie of the plaintife, the debt if it growe by eſpecialtie is veſted in the Queene, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is of an action of debt vpon a contract: <note n="p" place="margin">16.

Hen. 7. the outlawrie goeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in barre of the action, then to the writte, for there it is ſayde, that where a man cannot pleade to the writte, but by ſhewing of a matter in barre, there he may ſhewe it and conclude to the writte: for in an action of debt a man may pleade outlawrie in the plaintife, and conclude to the perſon, and yet the matter goeth in barre, and he may pleade it alſo in barre, <note n="q" place="margin">10.

Hen. 6. is verie playne, that where a man pleadeth that the plaintife is
<pb facs="tcp:2840:75"/> an alien borne, or a villaine, or an outlawed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is left to his choiſe, whether he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe ſpecial matters to the writte or to the action, <note n="t" place="margin">32.

E. 3. 24.</note> So 21. R. 2. in Aſsiſe brought by the husbande and wife againſt diuerſe perſons, the tenantes ſayde that the wife of the plaintife was entred into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the houſe of B. and there was a Nun profeſſed, &amp; demaunded iudgment if ſhe ſhould be aunſwered, and the Aſsiſe was adiorned into the common place, and a writte was ſent to the Biſhoppe to certifie, who certified that ſhe was profeſſed, wherefore the defendants praied that the husband and wife might be barred foreuer, and it was helde by the whole Court, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as the pea did ſtretche onely to diſable the wife of the plaintife, and if the husbande and wife had purchaſe iointly, that the baron ſhould notwithſtanding the diſablement haue an Aſsiſe of the whole, but otherwiſe it is if the husbande and wife bring an Aſsiſe, and a feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or releaſe of the husbande or the wife or of ſome aunceſtour of one of them bee pleaded in barre, both of them ſhall be barred, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this caſe it was helde that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought not to be that the husbande ſhould be barred, but by the aduiſe of the whole Court it was awarded that the husbande and the wife <hi>nihil capiant per breue ſuum, ſed eſſent in miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia.</hi>

Nay rather let him diuide the matter, and ſeuer that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible, from that which may bee, namely the paſsing thorough the riffe of the walle, from the killing of the childe: for it may bee, that in trueth the Diuell brought her in at the dore to kill the childe, though hee made it ſeeme to her that ſhe came in at a chinke of the wall: but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if there were no other fault in witches, then the renouncing of God and the abiuring of the Sacramentes; yet this being in it ſelfe conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate apoſtaſie, doth deſerue extreame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whoſoeuer thinketh that witches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the moſt part they be ſottiſh, old, &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting are verie eaſily deceiued, and therfore ought to be ſpared, hee is in a great errour, for malice driueth them to deſire that, which by the diuels meanes they compaſſe; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue obteined it, their froward nature doth ioy in it, and the diuel for the moſt part leaueth them, before they leaue him.</p>
